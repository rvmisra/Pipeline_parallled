# Pipeline_parallled
Bash script
Use at own risk.
Bsed on GATK recommendations.
Cange file inputs in the script and run pipeline on HPC servers
NOTE:
For snpEFF to work effectively, need to select the appropriate snpEFF database and set that as the reference for in the pipeline.
If new/unusual species, comment out snpEFF and run it seperately.  Creating a snpEFF database is non-trivial
